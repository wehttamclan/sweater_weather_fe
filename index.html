    <div class="box c">The two share a number of features: four doors, dual motors for all-wheel-drive, and a sporty level of performance.
    But, they also have distinct differences. The Audi puts the accent firmly on the first word in “sports sedan,” while
    the California car puts it on the latter. For clarity’s sake, we’re going to use the Model S 75D variant as we believe
    it is the most likely version to be cross-shopped with the e-tron GT.
    
    To begin, let’s talk range. The Audi will have a 90-kWh battery and is said to return 400 km (248.5 miles) under the
    WLTP regime. The Model S, with only a 75-kWh pack, is rated for 416.8 km (259 miles) using the EPA test, which is
    thought to be more realistic than the European system. Range-wise, then, the Tesla has an advantage of at least 10.5
    miles, and probably a bit more.
